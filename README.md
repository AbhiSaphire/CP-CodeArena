## Introduction
This repository includes all of my accepted solutions from different sites (mainly **GeeksforGeeks, Leetcode** & **Hackerank**) and coding contests.

## Note
* I highly recommend you to try and solve problems yourself and only after that look at the solutions here.
* All Solutions here are mostly written in Python3 and C++.
* `PS - I do not post ongoing contest solutions`
