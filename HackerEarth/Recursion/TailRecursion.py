# Factorial Function With and Without Tail Recursion

# The tail-recursive functions are considered better than 
# non-tail recursive functions as tail-recursion can be 
# optimized by compiler. The idea used by compilers to 
# optimize tail-recursive functions is simple, since the
# recursive call is the last statement, there is nothing 
# left to do in the current function, so saving the current 
# functionâ€™s stack frame is of no use.
